Due to the current world health crisis, many Filipino students are compelled to engage in Massive Open Online Course <br>
(MOOC) in order to continue with their studies, and the concept of ubiquitous learning (that is, learning anywhere, <br>
everywhere, anytime and every time) has been realized sooner than expected for many. As a student engaged in online <br>
learning, I would like you to reflect on your current situation as a learner. Write about the challenges you encounter <br>
every day, the funny moments you experienced, and personal suggestions as to how the learning process can be <br>
improved. You may also take a picture of your study room or take a screenshot of fun moments with your classmates <br>
etc.</p>

<p style="background-color:hsl(10, 100%, 80%); font-family:calibri">Due to the pandemic or the new normal that we are experiencing right now, it has been a hard time for me as a student who is new to the learning system. We were taught to not use gadgets while classes but now, it's already different. Sometimes are hard for me such as answering activities and quizzes and sometimes is a good day that I felt happy. Now that we are in an online class, it is important to make new friends and cooperate with your classmates. I am glad that I have friends right now that I can depend on and be open to. The challenges that I have come through every day are answering activities, slow internet connections, and sometimes even brownouts. There are many fun experiences that I have encountered also during online classes. Such as screenshotting funny faces from classmates, jokes from teachers, and even funny jokes to tell or stories from my friends through messenger. If you are having trouble in your classes, I can suggest that to keep notes in every session that the teacher is teaching, do not be shy to raise your hand and answer oral recitations, be open to your classmates so that you can cooperate better with each other and to always remember to have time management with your activities or favorite things to do. One piece of advice that I can give is always positive no matter what situation you are in, someone will be able to help you, and do not be discouraged when you are in your hardest times. Keep going further until you reach your goal and always remember that what you are doing is a step to your future goals. </p>
